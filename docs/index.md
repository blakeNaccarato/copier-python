:::{important}
This template is diverging into one focused on engineering research pipelines in [`softboiler`](https://github.com/softboiler), and a more general one in [`copyit`](https://github.com/copyit-org). These will not be proper "forks" of one another, but will eventually be synchronized by tooling developed in the `copyit` organization. This template will continue to specialize until I graduate, after which the simpler version will be recovered and maintained at `copyit`.
